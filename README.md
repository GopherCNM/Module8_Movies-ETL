# ETL â€“ Extract, Transform, Load  

## Overview of the project

The purpose of this project is to help Britta, an Amazing Prime employee, to prepare for a local hackathon that the company is sponsoring. Hackathon participants will use movie data to build algorithms to help to predict the popularity of low-budget movies.  

Using the extract, transform, load (ETL) process we:  
- Extracted movie data from Wikipedia and Kaggle
- Transformed the datasets by cleaning them and merging them into usable data frames, and
- Loaded the datasets into a SQL database.

In this assignment, we refactored the code from our practice module to create and run concise Python functions that will help to accomplish the ETL process to deliver clean hackathon data.
